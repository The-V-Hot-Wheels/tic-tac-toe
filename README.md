# Tic-Tac-Toe, ossia Noughts and Crosses

WORK IN PROGRESS. This is not the Challenge 6 project. This is research to help 
ourselves understand what's needed for a game involving two or more people using 
two or more devices.

See [Game Rules](GameRules.md) for the rules of the game. Without taking 
symmetry into account, there are only 255,168 possible games of Tic-Tac-Toe.
