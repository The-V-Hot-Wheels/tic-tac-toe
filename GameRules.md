# Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe

There are two players, one is associated with Xs (or crosses), the other with Os 
(or noughts). Either player may begin the game.

To start, make a 3 &times; 3 board with four lines (two horizontal, two 
vertical).

The player who goes first makes his mark (an X or an O) in whatever square he 
chooses. Then the other player makes his mark or any empty square, and they take 
turns until either one player wins or all squares are filled up.

If a player gets three of his marks in a horizontal line, a vertical line or a 
diagonal line, then he wins. But if all squares are filled up with neither 
player getting three in a line, the game is a tie.
