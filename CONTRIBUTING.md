# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2024 contributors

This project *might* be open to Hacktoberfest 2024.

* Contributors must have Xcode.
* Make your own branch, name it after yourself, or after a feature if 
appropriate.
* Prefer small commits, and group commits into pull requests.
* Write meaningful commit messages. This is easier with smaller commits.
* Never delete tests, unless you have very good and easy to explain reason for 
doing so (e.g., the class under test is deprecated and marked for removal).
* You may refactor to comply with Swift naming conventions, but be kind with 
contributors who don't know the Swift naming conventions.
